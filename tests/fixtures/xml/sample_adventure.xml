      <subsection>RULES TO GAME BY</subsection>
      <p>As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game.</p>
      <p>When in doubt, make it up! It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.</p>
      <p>It's not a competition. The DM isn't competing against the player characters.</p>
